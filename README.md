# Cloud Formation Fundamentals

This project allow me to discover IaC and more particularly AWS CloudFormation.

This project aims to deploy the architecture describes in another project right [there](https://medium.com/@issam.sisbane/enhancing-my-cloud-skills-week-5-aws-networking-7a93a503d6d5).

I could deploy all the resources presents in the template with clickOps in a first time and then rebuild everything using IaC.

It was pretty fun to do and I saw how IaC can make easier the job to deploy and debug things as everything is stated in the template.
